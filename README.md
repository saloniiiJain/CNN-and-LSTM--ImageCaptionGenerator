# ImageCaptionGenerator-using CNN and LSTM

Image caption generation using CNN and LSTM is a deep learning project that aims to generate natural language captions for images. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to create an end-to-end model that can generate captions for images.

The project uses a pre-trained CNN model, such as VGG or Inception, to extract features from the input image. These features are then fed into an LSTM network that generates a sequence of words to describe the image.

The model is trained on a dataset of images with their corresponding captions. During training, the model learns to predict the next word in the sequence given the previous words and the image features. The training is performed using a combination of cross-entropy loss and beam search optimization.

The project includes code and detailed instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and inference. It also provides a pre-trained model that can be used for caption generation on new images.

The project is available on GitHub and can be easily adapted to work with different image datasets and network architectures. It is a useful tool for researchers and developers working in the field of computer vision and natural language processing.
